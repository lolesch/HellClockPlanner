Dear @Clockmakers and theory-crafters out here:

I am excited to announce the release of [Hellclock Builder](https://lolesch.github.io/HellClockBuilder/) - a tool to theory craft your optimal runs. 
It is in *beta state* and with the upcoming release most of its content requires a review once new data is available. 
Big shoutout to @Monddoc who initialized and supported the project!

**#Roadmap** in no particular order
- equipment
- trinkets
- relics
- shrines
- foundations
- great bell
- import save files (if still accessible after release)
- share your build with your friends
