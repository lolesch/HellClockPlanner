### Questions
- is it possible access the data base?
	- in what format do you store your database? (.json, google sheets, ...)
- is it possible to access art assets?
- will save files still be saved as .json after release?
  
### Dear Rogue Snails,

Thank you for this awesome piece of work!

Throughout the past month I've recreate the database-part of the game to build a tool that presents all the info in one place.
The [HellClockBuilder 0.1](https://lolesch.github.io/HellClockBuilder/) - it is in *beta state* and many features are still in progress but with the release around the corner I am eager to announce it to the community.
With your permission I'd like to announce it on the hellclock discord server and would like to ask for a dedicated "HellClockBuilder" channel.

To build the prototype I gathered data from playing the game and messing with the .json save files. It is all stored in a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17eNmTa4YziI9Fv3kL4vu1dRqnJSeAk51T-3yxneDSzY/edit?usp=sharing) but I reached the point where the real data would help immensely.
- is it possible to gain access to your database? In what format do you store it?
- is it possible to gain access to art assets such as icons (skills, relics, proficiencies...)

Cheers, @lolesch
